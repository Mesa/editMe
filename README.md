jQuery Plugin for on page content editing

What is EditMe?
-----------------
EditMe is a jQuery Plugin to allow on page content editing and saving data with a Ajax Post request.
For Example: your Administration Area got a List displaying Name, E-Mail, Last Login and so on...
When you want to edit the User data you normaly create an extra "edit user" Page or use a jQuery Dialog.
Now you can hit an edit Button and change the Username right in place. When you're ready yout hit the
save Button and all changed data go via Ajax POST request to your server.
